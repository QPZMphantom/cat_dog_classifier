# cat_dog_classifier

This project is a classic image classification model that distinguishes between cats and dogs using a CNN. It is trained on a labeled dataset and can accurately predict unseen images. The project is useful for learning about image preprocessing, CNN architecture, and deployment using Keras.

Key Features:

Binary classification (cat vs. dog)
Custom-trained CNN using Keras
Scripts for data preprocessing and prediction
File structure:
cat_dog_classifier.py: Main script for model training
run_predict.py: Inference script
cat_dog_model.h5: Saved model weights
dataset/: Contains training and validation images
Unknown.jpeg: Sample image for testing
