# 🐶 cat_dog_classifier

This project is a classic image classification model that distinguishes between **cats** and **dogs** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is trained on a labeled dataset and can accurately predict unseen images. The project is useful for learning about image preprocessing, CNN architecture, and deployment using Keras.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Binary classification**: Cat vs. Dog
- **Custom-trained CNN** using Keras
- **Scripts** for data preprocessing, training, and prediction
- **.h5 model** for quick inference
